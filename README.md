# Shopping List
Shopping list created with React, Typescript, StyledComponents, Redux

## Main goal
The user should be able to add products to a shopping list and marked them as already bought. The fields that the list should accept would be:
- Name
- Amount (How many do you need?)
- Price per item (Estimated)
- Store (Where to buy it)

When the products are bought, the total price of them should be shown to the user, so it could know how much is he spending on the store.
